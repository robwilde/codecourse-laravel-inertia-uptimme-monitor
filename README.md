## About this course
Ready to dive into Inertia? Let's build a real-world app with Laravel, Inertia and Vue! If you're already working with Inertia, you'll pick up some tips and techniques for future projects.

This uptime monitor allows you to create and switch between sites, then add endpoints to monitor with frequency intervals. Using the power of scheduling and queues, it'll automatically alert the email addresses you've added via the UI when an endpoint goes down.

* Perform actions on models at user-defined intervals
* Work with sub-minute schedules in Laravel
* Send out channel notifications with Laravel
* Use API resources to simplify Inertia data
